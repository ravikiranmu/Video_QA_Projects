Test Project 1 :

Question/Problem statement

Assume a scenario where there is 15 min length video (hls format with manifest, segments & vtt) & because of outcome of a video review or censorship, we are asked to cut of the video between 5th to 8th min reducing the total video length to 12 min. 

Considering this scenario, create a test plan & develop test scripts/framework to validate the test cases around it.

Overall objective is to validate..
1. Video is not damaged and the segments/manifest is as expected post video cut
2. Vtts are in sync with video post cut and there is no case of subtitles out of sync or any subtitle issues.

Output
1. Make sure the github repo is shared
2. Generate Video validation report to show the correctness of video, post cut.
3. Generate a report to show all required segment are intact post cut
4. Generate a report to show vtts/subtitles are in sync for each segment.
